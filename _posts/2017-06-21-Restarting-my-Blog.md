Long story short, I had completely forgotten how to use Github. I remembered how to do the basics. However, I start screaming loudly inside of my body as soon as I open the 'style.scss' code. I tried changing the colour of the background of my blog. Somehow, I couldn’t work it out and changed every colour to the colour I wanted until I found which was the background. Yes, I panicked completely. On the other hand, I managed to change my name and caption in the very friendly ‘config.yml’ code. Unfortunately, that is probably the most advanced thing I did this week, because I’m struggling with the language of coding.
