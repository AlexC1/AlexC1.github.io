Still Images

Today we learnt about what makes a good still image, based on a brief given to us by the teacher. The brief given was broad, and in a group we made our own interpretations, and then displayed them to the class. The class then had to work out what was happening in our still image. If our still image was successful, everyone would be able to guess what we were doing in the still image. The key to success in this game was teamwork. Your actions had to be relevant to that of your partners, or it wouldn't seem like it was one still image. Another key aspect of still images relevant to this task was exaggeration. This was used to show exactly what you were doing. For example, to look really cold, i bent my knees and crossed my arms, keeping them tight to myself. 

One thing I was forgetting to do throughout the activity was using my whole body. I was so focused on one part of my body that, at points, I completely forgot the rest, and so it looked out of character. As the session went on, I felt I gained more confidence in this aspect. I think that eventually I got the hang of still images, but I still need to do some work to incorporate every aspect of a good still image. I enjoyed the freedom of working off of a brief that was broad, because I felt it helped to get my creativity across to my peers. 

Overall, I feel that I've now learnt what creates the best still image; teamwork, use of the whole body, exaggeration, facial expression, keeping still, and many more. I hope that soon I will be able to fully incorporate these aspects into my own still images.
